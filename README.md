## git and branching

From master & a clean working team:
- git checkout -b name-branch

pushing a branch (once added and committed on a branch)
 - git push origin <branch-name>

Go to github and merge branch to master

what happens is the master timeline in github is ahead of your local timeline, so now we need to pull from github.

in our local master:
  git pull origin master
